## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Gradual component-by-component animation migration (rejected: creates inconsistency during transition period)
- **ALT-002**: Keep existing custom animations and only add design system for new components (rejected: doesn't achieve consistency goal)
- **ALT-003**: Implement animations using CSS-in-JS libraries like Framer Motion (rejected: inconsistent with project's utility-first approach)
- **ALT-004**: Use only CSS animations without JavaScript interactions (rejected: limits interactive feedback capabilities)
- **ALT-005**: Create custom animation library instead of using design system utilities (rejected: unnecessary complexity and maintenance burden)

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: Design system utilities library (`src/lib/design-system.ts`) must include complete animation utility set
- **DEP-002**: HeroUI React components must provide proper animation support (Spinner, Skeleton, transitions)
- **DEP-003**: Tailwind configuration must include all animation classes and timing functions
- **DEP-004**: CSS custom properties system must remain functional for gradual migration of other systems
- **DEP-005**: Browser support requirements must be maintained for all animation features
- **DEP-006**: Performance monitoring tools must be available to validate animation impact

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Animation performance might degrade on older devices or browsers with limited CSS animation support
- **RISK-002**: Custom transition timing might affect existing user workflows that depend on specific animation durations
- **RISK-003**: Focus state changes might impact users with assistive technologies or keyboard navigation patterns
- **RISK-004**: Loading state animations might interfere with existing error handling or form validation feedback
- **RISK-005**: Micro-interactions might become distracting or annoying with frequent use
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: All design system animation utilities (ds.animation.\*) provide equivalent functionality to replaced custom CSS
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: HeroUI components support all required animation states and transitions
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: User preferences for reduced motion are properly handled by Tailwind and browser defaults
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: Current component layouts can accommodate new animation patterns without breaking
- **ASSUMPTION-005**: Animation changes won't negatively impact form submission timing or validation feedback
