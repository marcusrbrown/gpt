# Introduction

![Status: In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Progress-yellow)

This implementation plan establishes a comprehensive testing framework for the GPT research platform using Playwright for end-to-end testing, automated visual regression testing, accessibility testing with axe-core, performance benchmarking with Lighthouse, and a unified test coverage dashboard with badge integration. The framework will ensure code quality, UI consistency, accessibility compliance, and performance standards while providing clear visibility into test metrics.

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Cypress instead of Playwright - Rejected due to limited cross-browser support and less robust visual testing capabilities
- **ALT-002**: Percy or Chromatic for visual regression - Rejected to maintain self-hosted solution and avoid external service dependencies
- **ALT-003**: Manual accessibility audits only - Rejected due to lack of automation and consistency in CI/CD pipeline
- **ALT-004**: WebPageTest for performance testing - Rejected in favor of Lighthouse for better CI integration and local testing capabilities

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Cross-platform rendering differences may cause visual test flakiness - Mitigated by consistent Docker environments and pixel tolerance configuration
- **RISK-002**: Large screenshot files may impact repository size - Mitigated by Git LFS configuration and artifact retention policies
- **RISK-003**: Accessibility testing may reveal extensive existing violations - Addressed by phased remediation plan and rule exclusion configuration
- **RISK-004**: Performance tests may be sensitive to CI environment variations - Mitigated by multiple test runs and statistical analysis
- **RISK-005**: Increased CI execution time may slow development workflow - Addressed by parallel execution and selective test running based on code changes
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: GitHub Actions will remain the primary CI/CD platform
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Current application architecture supports comprehensive E2E testing without major modifications
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Development team will adopt Page Object Model pattern for test maintenance
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: Visual design changes will follow established approval workflow for baseline updates
