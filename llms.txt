# GPT

> Research and development platform for creating LLM-powered AI agents and assistants with complete data sovereignty, supporting multiple AI platforms including Ollama, Anthropic, and Azure OpenAI Service.

The project combines modern AI frameworks with web technologies to create a flexible development environment for experimentation with LLM architectures and advanced AI interaction patterns. Built with TypeScript, React, and LangChain, it provides both a web interface and Jupyter notebook environment for agent development.
