## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Vision Statement

Create a powerful, user-friendly platform that enables technical users to create, customize, and use AI assistants (GPTs) with complete data sovereignty. The platform mirrors the capabilities of cloud-based GPT creation tools while keeping all data locally controlled, supporting multiple LLM providers, and providing seamless sharing and export options.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**

1. Cloud-based GPT platforms (ChatGPT, Claude) require sending sensitive data to third parties
2. Users lack control over conversation history and assistant configurations
3. No ability to use local/self-hosted models with the same UX as commercial platforms
4. Vendor lock-in prevents portability of assistant configurations
5. Enterprise users cannot meet data residency requirements with cloud solutions

**Target Solution:** A local-first platform where users own their data, choose their AI providers, and maintain full control over their assistant configurations.

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Storage Architecture

#### Web Platform (Primary)

```

**IndexedDB Schema:**

```typescript
// Dexie.js database definition
class GPTDatabase extends Dexie {
  gpts!: Table<GPTConfiguration>
  conversations!: Table<Conversation>
  messages!: Table<Message>
  knowledgeFiles!: Table<KnowledgeFile>
  secrets!: Table<EncryptedSecret>

  constructor() {
    super("gpt-platform")
    this.version(1).stores({

      conversations: "id, gptId, updatedAt, *tags",
      messages: "id, conversationId, timestamp",
      knowledgeFiles: "id, gptId, name, mimeType",
      secrets: "id, provider",
      settings: "key",
    })
  }
}
```

#### Desktop Platform (Tauri - Phase 4)

```

```

### 5.2 Security Architecture

#### API Key Encryption Flow

```
User Passphrase

       ▼
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐

  Session Key (memory only, cleared on tab close)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Passphrase never stored; derived key kept in memory only
- Each secret has unique IV (initialization vector)
- Re-encryption required on passphrase change
- Session timeout configurable (default: 30 minutes)

### 5.3 Provider Abstraction Layer

```typescript
interface LLMProvider {
  id: string
  name: string

  // Configuration
  validateCredentials: (config: ProviderConfig) => Promise<ValidationResult>
  listModels: () => Promise<Model[]>

  // Operations
  createCompletion: (request: CompletionRequest) => AsyncIterable<CompletionChunk>
  createEmbedding?: (text: string) => Promise<number[]>

  // Capabilities
  supportsVision: boolean
  supportsTools: boolean
  supportsStreaming: boolean
}
```

### 5.4 Sync Architecture (Phase 4+)

**Strategy:** CRDTs via Yjs for conflict-free synchronization

```

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                           | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Browser storage quota exceeded | Medium      | High   | Clear warnings, desktop fallback, cloud storage option |
| API provider rate limits       | Medium      | Medium | Retry logic, user-visible quota tracking               |
| MCP specification changes      | Low         | Medium | Version pinning, abstraction layer                     |
| IndexedDB corruption           | Low         | High   | Export backups, integrity checks on load               |
| WebCrypto API limitations      | Low         | Medium | Fallback to session-only storage                       |

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. Users have modern browsers with IndexedDB and Web Crypto API support
2. Users can obtain their own API keys from LLM providers
3. For local models, users can install and run Ollama independently
4. Network is available for initial load and API calls (not for local operations)

### External Dependencies

| Dependency    | Version | Purpose           | Fallback             |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Dexie.js      | ^4.0    | IndexedDB wrapper | Direct IndexedDB API |
| OpenAI SDK    | ^4.0    | API client        | Fetch-based client   |
| Anthropic SDK | ^0.20   | API client        | Fetch-based client   |
| Yjs           | ^13.0   | CRDT sync         | Manual export/import |
| Tauri         | ^2.0    | Desktop runtime   | Web-only deployment  |
