# src/components/docs/AGENTS.md

This directory contains components that power in-app documentation/help content.

## Scope

- Layout and navigation for docs-like views.
- Interactive/tutorial components used in the app.

## Conventions

- Treat docs UI as product UI: accessible, keyboard-friendly, and aligned with design tokens.
- Keep content components presentational; move storage/provider logic to hooks/services.

## References
