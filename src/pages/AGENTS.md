# src/pages/AGENTS.md

This directory contains route-level page components.

## Conventions

- Pages compose components and hooks; avoid embedding provider-specific SDK logic.
- Keep routing concerns in pages; keep reusable UI in `src/components/`.
- Ensure pages are accessible (proper headings, landmarks, and focus management).
